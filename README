A simple example showing how to use the GeoIP API in PHP with the free database 
from http://maxmind.com

Before you can run this you'll need to install the data files, either using the
one included in this package or downloading the latest from 
http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
Once you have the GeoLiteCity.dat file downloaded and unzipped, copy it to
/usr/local/share/GeoIP (or update the code below to reflect the location you've
actually installed it in).
 
Based on code from http://pear.php.net/package/Net_GeoIP/ with the PEAR 
dependencies removed. Adapted by Pete Warden <pete@petewarden.com>
For more details see http://petewarden.typepad.com/ and see
http://web.mailana.com/labs/geoip_example/ for a live example.
